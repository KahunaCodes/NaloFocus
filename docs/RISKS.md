## Active Risks

### RISK-001: EventKit API Limitations
**Status**: 🟡 Active - Monitoring
**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: Possible
**Impact**: High
**Overall Risk Level**: 🟡 Medium

**Description**:
EventKit API may have undocumented limitations or behaviors that could prevent core functionality from working as designed.

**Potential Impact**:
- Cannot update reminder times programmatically
- Cannot create reminders in specific lists
- Permission model more restrictive than expected
- Performance issues with large numbers of reminders

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. ✅ Early proof of concept (Day 3) to validate all required operations
2. ⏳ Test with multiple account types (iCloud, Exchange, Local)
3. ⏳ Have fallback plan for any limitations discovered
4. ⏳ Document any workarounds needed

**Contingency Plan**:
- If critical limitation found, pivot to alternative approach
- Consider using Calendar events instead of Reminders
- Worst case: Create our own notification system

### RISK-002: macOS 15+ Requirement Limits User Base
**Status**: 🟢 Accepted
**Category**: Business
**Likelihood**: Likely
**Impact**: Medium
**Overall Risk Level**: 🟡 Medium

**Description**:
Requiring macOS 15+ will limit the potential user base as many users may still be on older versions.

**Potential Impact**:
- Reduced initial user adoption
- Negative reviews from users on older systems
- Limited market reach

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. ✅ Clear communication in all marketing materials
2. ✅ App Store listing clearly states requirements
3. ⏳ Consider lowering requirement if technically feasible
4. ⏳ Plan for future backward compatibility

**Contingency Plan**:
- If adoption is too low, investigate supporting macOS 14
- Create simplified version for older systems if demand exists

**Owner**: Product Team
**Review Date**: Post-launch

### RISK-003: Reminder Account Compatibility Issues
**Status**: 🟡 Active - Monitoring
**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: Possible
**Impact**: Medium
**Overall Risk Level**: 🟡 Medium

**Description**:
Different reminder account types (iCloud, Exchange, Local) may behave differently or have different capabilities.

**Potential Impact**:
- Features work with some accounts but not others
- Exchange accounts might have corporate restrictions
- Local accounts might not support all features
- Sync issues with iCloud

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. ⏳ Test with all account types during development
2. ⏳ Document any account-specific limitations
3. ⏳ Implement account type detection
4. ⏳ Provide clear error messages for unsupported operations

**Contingency Plan**:
- Disable features for specific account types if needed
- Provide clear documentation about supported accounts
- Focus on iCloud as primary use case

### RISK-004: Performance with Large Number of Reminders
**Status**: 🟢 Watching
**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: Unlikely
**Impact**: Medium
**Overall Risk Level**: 🟢 Low

**Description**:
Users with hundreds or thousands of reminders might experience performance issues.

**Potential Impact**:
- Slow reminder picker loading
- UI lag when scrolling
- Memory usage spikes
- Slow sprint creation

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. ⏳ Implement lazy loading for reminder picker
2. ⏳ Add search to reduce displayed items
3. ⏳ Profile performance with large datasets
4. ⏳ Implement pagination if needed

**Contingency Plan**:
- Add reminder count limits
- Implement virtual scrolling
- Cache reminder data appropriately

### RISK-005: App Store Review Rejection
**Status**: 🟢 Watching
**Category**: Business
**Likelihood**: Unlikely
**Impact**: Low
**Overall Risk Level**: 🟢 Low

**Description**:
App might be rejected during App Store review for various reasons.

**Potential Impact**:
- Delayed launch
- Need to make changes and resubmit
- Potential feature removal

**Common Rejection Reasons**:
- Insufficient functionality (too simple)
- EventKit permission usage not justified
- UI issues or crashes
- Metadata problems

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. ⏳ Follow App Store guidelines carefully
2. ⏳ Provide detailed review notes
3. ⏳ Test thoroughly before submission
4. ⏳ Have TestFlight beta first

**Contingency Plan**:
- Direct distribution via website if needed
- Address feedback quickly and resubmit
- Have backup launch date

### RISK-006: Complex UI State Management
**Status**: 🟢 Watching
**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: Possible
**Impact**: Low
**Overall Risk Level**: 🟢 Low

**Description**:
Dynamic task rows and complex picker might lead to state management bugs.

**Potential Impact**:
- UI inconsistencies
- Lost user input
- Confusing user experience
- Hard to debug issues

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. ✅ Use MVVM pattern for clear state management
2. ⏳ Comprehensive unit tests for view models
3. ⏳ UI tests for critical paths
4. ⏳ Clear state reset after operations

**Contingency Plan**:
- Simplify UI if too complex
- Add more explicit state management
- Increase testing coverage
